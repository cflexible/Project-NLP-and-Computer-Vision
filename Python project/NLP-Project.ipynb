    "I have used this website as a starting point for this chatbot:\n",
    "<u>https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/</u>\n",

    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many problems to run that on an actual system.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   M2 Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Intel Mac\n",

    "\n",
    "First I had the problem that all elements on the application window were\n",
    "black except a wonderful Mac like Button in white and a scrollbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found out that the Python version 3.8 was to old and so I updated to\n",
    "3.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that and globally to let run the program you have to install all\n",
    "these libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   nltk\n",

    "with this command:\n",

    "You also need the tinker part to create the window view:\n",
    "\n",
    "**sudo apt-get install python3-tk**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you could have a running program. But on a Mac it looks not like\n",
    "expected. In the code the defined button has a green color. On a Mac it\n",
    "has a white color because the library uses the system colors and so the\n",
    "named background colors are ignored. Only to set the letter color is\n",
    "working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use this as a chatbot, you have to let run the\n",

    "**train_chatbot.py**\n",

    "which has some more challenges. These are marked in the comments at\n",

    "## Additional information\n",
    "To train the NLP chatbot part the file intents.json is used. In this file the expected texts and their responses are defined. But this file is not only used by the training part. It is also used by the runtime program."
