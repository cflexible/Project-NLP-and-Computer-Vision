# Project-NLP-and-Computer-Vision
This is a simple project for IU (International University) course DLMAIEAIS02.

This project is just a simple chatbot to ask for some weather information of a location.

It contains 3 main files.
The first file train_chatbot.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook to train a NLP. This file uses the intents.json in which the rules of the NLP are defined.
After running this notebook the class files are generated which are used by the main Jupyter notebook NLP-Project.ipynb.

With checking out the whole repository the NLP-Project notebook should run instantly.
